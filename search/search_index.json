In order to accomplish this, my subsystem comprises of a solar tracking array, consisting of a microcontroller, motor, motor driver, and light sensor.

Most importantly, the device must be functional and functional for long enough to serve as a useful teaching tool. In order to accomplish this, parts must be selected with quality and robustness in mind. Furthermore, the budget must be taken into consideration as well. If parts get too expensive, it is easy to exceed the projected budget. But most importantly, the parts were selected with compatability in mind. If the parts struggle to interface with each other, we will create unnecessary roadblocks for our team further down the line. Overall, the criteria for each selected part included quality, cost, and compatability among other things. </p>"},{"location":"component-selection/#components","title":"Components","text":""},{"location":"component-selection/#microcontroller","title":"Microcontroller","text":""},{"location":"component-selection/#option-1","title":"Option 1","text":"Option Pros Cons Unit Cost &amp; Link PIC16F18875 Multiple timers, hardware PWM, and various communication peripherals No WiFi/Bluetooth $1.82 (DigiKey)(https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC16F18875-I-PT/5803538) Supports I2C Limited RAM compared to ESP32 Reliable MPLAB XC8 &amp; MCC support 5V operation (compatible with most motor drivers)"},{"location":"component-selection/#option-2","title":"Option 2","text":"Option Pros Cons Unit Cost &amp; Link PIC18F47Q10 includes multiple timers, Configurable Logic Cells (CLC), ADCs, comparators, and communication modules (I2C, SPI, EUSART) No WiFi/Bluetooth $2.52 (DigiKey)(https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC18F47Q10-I-P/10187785) better power management modes and improved performance Limited RAM compared to ESP32 supported by the MPLAB\u00ae Snap In-Circuit Debugger/Programmer 5V operation (compatible with most motor drivers)"},{"location":"component-selection/#option-3","title":"Option 3","text":"Option Pros Cons Unit Cost &amp; Link PIC16F877A You can program and debug it via ICSP No WiFi/Bluetooth $1.82 (DigiKey)(https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC16F877A-I-P/446143) Very popular MCU to use, a lot of support online may need to write lower-level code to manage interrupts or to generate precise step timing Can run on very little power 5V operation (compatible with most motor drivers)"},{"location":"component-selection/#final-selection-pic16f18875-option-3","title":"Final Selection: PIC16F18875 (Option 3)","text":""},{"location":"component-selection/#rationale","title":"Rationale:","text":"<p>The microcontroller I decided to use for this project was the PIC16F18875, as there is an abundance of resources and information online,  There also more examples online on how to use a stepper driver with this PIC controller than any other PIC controller.

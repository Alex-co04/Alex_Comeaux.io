# Component Selection

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive and educational product for k-12 students to learn about weather and the weather cycle. In order to accomplish this, my subsystem comprises of a solar tracking array, consisting of a microcontroller, motor, motor driver, and light sensor. These components will all interface with the other subsystems and actively track either the most intense light in the environment, or track the position of the sun itself via local weather data.


## Criteria

In order for this project to be successful, there are many criteria that must be met. Most importantly, the device must be functional and functional for long enough to serve as a useful teaching tool. In order to accomplish this, parts must be selected with quality and robustness in mind. Furthermore, the budget must be taken into consideration as well. If parts get too expensive, it is easy to exceed the projected budget. But most importantly, the parts were selected with compatability in mind. If the parts struggle to interface with each other, we will create unnecessary roadblocks for our team further down the line. Overall, the criteria for each selected part included quality, cost, and compatability among other things.

![1528-1367-ND](./assets/images/MFG_918.jpg)
#### Rationale:
The actuator I decided to go with for this project is option 1, the Nema 14 stepper motor. This option is the most realistic as it will be easiest to interface with a stepper driver and PIC microcontroller. Additionally, this actuator is the easiest to use in terms of precise movement.

## Final Selection: IFX9201SG (Option 1)
![1528-1367-ND](./assets/images/SerialDriver.jpg)

#### Rationale:
The driver I decided to go with for the DC motor was option 1. This is because the surrounding circuitry is easier to set up, and there are more resources at my disposal for integration. Additionally, the motor driver is proven to be working with the PIC18F47Q10 through SPI serial communication. 

## Stepper Motor Driver
### Option 1

| **Option** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Unit Cost & Link** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| | 6-50V |

## Final Selection: ULN2003 (Option 2)
![Motor-Driver](./assets/images/DCMotorDriver.jpg)
#### Rationale:
I concluded that this driver was the most suitable for my project because most of the online resources on how to control stepper motors used this particular driver. Additionally, although it lacks reverse voltage protection, it is not difficult to implement flyback diodes. 

## Power Regulation
This project will require two seperate voltage lines, and therefore two voltage regulators. The motors pull too much current to be connected to the same line as the drivers and microcontroller.

I decided that the best visible light detector for the solar array is the PDV-P9203 Photo-resistor. This is because it will be the easiest to interface with the PIC microcontroller. Additionally, there are many example project online using the same photo-resistor. 



## Basic MCC Setup
![Image:MCC](./assets/images/image_2025-02-07_183502901.png)

This is my rudamentary setup for the microcontroller's MCC in MPLabX. As you can see, there are pins designated for the SPI Motor Driver, PWM for the stepper, as well as UART TX and RX pins for upstream and downstream communication.

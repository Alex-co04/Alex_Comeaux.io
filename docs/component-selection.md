# Component Selection

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive and educational product for k-12 students to learn about weather and the weather cycle. In order to accomplish this, my subsystem comprises of a solar tracking array, consisting of a microcontroller, motor, motor driver, and light sensor. These components will all interface with the other subsystems and actively track either the most intense light in the environment, or track the position of the sun itself via local weather data.


## Criteria

In order for this project to be successful, there are many criteria that must be met. Most importantly, the device must be functional and functional for long enough to serve as a useful teaching tool. In order to accomplish this, parts must be selected with quality and robustness in mind. Furthermore, the budget must be taken into consideration as well. If parts get too expensive, it is easy to exceed the projected budget. But most importantly, the parts were selected with compatability in mind. If the parts struggle to interface with each other, we will create unnecessary roadblocks for our team further down the line. Overall, the criteria for each selected part included quality, cost, and compatability among other things.

## Final Selection: PIC16F18875 (Option 3)
#### Rationale:
The microcontroller I decided to use for this project was the PIC16F18875, as there is an abundance of resources and information online,  There also more examples online on how to use a stepper driver with this PIC controller than any other PIC controller. In addition to this, although a slightly older model, the microcontroller is fully compatible with MPLabX and the Snap debugger.


## Actuator
### Option 1
![Image:1528-1367-ND](docs\assets\images\MFG_918.jpg)

| | 6V operational voltage|

## Final Selection: 1528-1367-ND (Option 1)
#### Rationale:
The actuator I decided to go with for this project is option 1, the Nema 14 stepper motor. This option is the most realistic as it will be easiest to interface with a stepper driver and PIC microcontroller. Additonally, this actuator is the easiest to use in terms of precise movement.  

## Motor Driver

| | 6-50V |

## Final Selection: A4988 (Option 1)
#### Rationale:
I concluded that this driver was the most suitable for my project because most of the online resources on how to control stepper motors used this particular driver. Additionally, although it lacks reverse voltage protection, it is not difficult to implement flyback diodes.

## Overview
This page contains the block diagram for my motor subsystem. The block diagram includes two motor driver blocks, one for the stepper motor and the DC motor. Additionally, the MCU will be equipped with UART, SPI, and an ADC module. The UART will be used for upstream and downstream communication, the SPI for motor control, and the ADC for confirming sensor data and for debugging.
